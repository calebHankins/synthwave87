# A Dark blue fork of synthwave84 vscode css

*An Unholy Mashup Of Two Better vscode Themes To Create A Mess Only A Mother Could Love*

## Why

This repo mainly exists so I can revert to a previous config after deciding that it was way better than whatever fresh new hell I came up with.

## What

Stylesheet to tweak the cool [Winter is Coming (Dark Blue)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.winteriscoming) vscode theme using the radical [SynthWave '84 glow css](https://github.com/robb0wen/synthwave-vscode/blob/master/synthwave84.css) as a base.

## How

- I'm using John Papa's [Winter is Coming (Dark Blue)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnpapa.winteriscoming) Code theme as a base
- **Below here there be dragons. Read the Disclaimers / Words of caution and access the risk before continuing. [I'd recommend backing up vscode settings before trying this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Shan.code-settings-sync) in case you have to nuke your install from orbit**
- [Custom CSS](synthwave87.css) forked from the way better [SynthWave '84 Code theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RobbOwen.synthwave-vscode)
- Custom CSS applied via [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css)
- Instead of heeding the warnings about modifying core vscode files, toggle off the [Unsupported] vscode title bar header by [fixing the vscode checksums](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lehni.vscode-fix-checksums)
  - [Surely nothing can go wrong doing this](https://github.com/lehni/vscode-fix-checksums#disclaimer--a-word-of-caution)
